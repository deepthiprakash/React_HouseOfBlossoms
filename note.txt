Difference between angular and react
--------------------------------------
Angular                  |               React
---------                |              --------------
framework of js          |              library of js
real DOM                 |              Virtual DOM

Advantages of React

2. Reusable components
3. jsx (javascript xml) 

components in react
---------------------
1. Class based
2. function based
other 2 types are statefull-which has state and stateless-which dont have state components

React hooks

state
------

useState is the hook used in react to create state

props  (shortform of properties)
------
to share datas from parent to child component
destructuring is used to avoid props

API call in js
---------------
Ajax
-----
3 methods-
XmlHttp
fetch
asynch await

first working hook of a component
----------------------------------
useEffect- React

Redirection/Routing in React
------------------------------
react-router-dom  - library used for Routing

Browser router - wrap the main component inside browser router component
Route - wrap the component inside Router which need Redirection
Routes - wrap all the Router if we set more than one component paths

Link- a component in react-router-dom used for Redirection (like navigate by url in angular)

useParams - hook in react-router-dom used to access params
